        <br><br><br><p>when the human kept walking, they saw a Satyr woman watering some wildflowers near a doorway-shaped hole in the wall of the cave. She looked up and seemed surprised to see the human. the satyr woman was kind, and seemed very motherly. the satyr woman told the human that they were welcome to stay at her house. the human agrred, there was nowhere else they could go, and this woman made them feel safe.</p><br><br>
        <p>when the satyr woman brought the human to her house, the human asked about how they could get home, but the woman just kept saying "it isn't safe up there". the satyr woman seemed sad every time the human asked. the human tried finding their own way out of the house, and found a basement with a locked door. there seemed to be a cold breeze coming from the other side. when they went to open the door, the satyr woman came down the stairs, and tried to stop the human. she said that her own child had been hurt while trying to leave, and didn't want others to be hurt as well. the human reassured he rthat she would be ok, and helped her realise that she didn't need to protect everyone she met. The satyr unlocked the door, and the human stepped into the white landscape beyond</p> <br><br>
