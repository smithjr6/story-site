        <p>the human found themselves in a very beautiful cavern, with glowing moss, flowers, and mushrooms. there were many small streams running along the path, and the dirt was squishy underneath the human's shoes. They continued along the path, when a fish woman jumped out from behind a corner. the fish woman was yelling about wanting the human to fight them. the human refused, and ran away. the fish woman searched and chased the human for a long time, and started laughing halfway through. after a while, the fish woman was rolling on the floor, laughing. the human was confused, and the fish woman said that they haven't had this much fun in a really long time. the fish lady thanked the human, and showed them to the next cavern. the human was still confusd about what happened, but they were glad they had made a new friend. the human stepped toward the entrance, feeling really hot air blow toward them.</p>
