        <p>the human found themselves in a snowy forest. but there was a cavern roof far above, snow should be impossible. shaking off the logistics of a snow forest in a cave, the human progressed onward. they heard voices and hurried toward them. the human found two large rabbits talking to each other. one was tall and skinny, and the other was short and chubby. the tall one seemed to be mad at the short one for making jokes about his "predicament". the human asked what was going on, startling the tall rabbit. he loudly procaimed that he had lost several pieces to his puzzle, and could'nt find them anywhere. the human offered to help the rabbit search. as they scoured the forest, the human got to know the two rabbits better. they were brothers. the short one was lazy and comedic, while the tall one was hard-working, and confident in their abilities. the human helped find all the puzzle pieces, after making two new friends. the human felt bad about moving on, but they knew that their parents would be worried about them. the two rabbits helped show the human where the next part of the cavern was. they warned that the monster in the wetlands could be a bit agressive, and waved goodbye as the human travelled into the Wetlands.</p>
